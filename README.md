# MultiMC Forge Installer for 1.13+
After trying to manually install forge in multiple 1.14 MultiMC instances, I decided to create a (mostly automatic) installer. 

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to get up and running with the installer.

### Prerequisites
- [Minecraft Forge Installer for 1.13+](https://files.minecraftforge.net) - Must be a .jar
- An already created MultiMC instance on the same version as the forge installer

### Running
Make sure the MultiMC installer and the Forge installer are in the same folder. Before you run the MultiMC installer, know where your MultiMC and instances are installed. Run the installer and follow the instructions on screen.
